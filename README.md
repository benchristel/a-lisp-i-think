# A Lisp, I Think

I'm making a programming language. I think it's a Lisp. But
I don't know Lisp, so I'm not sure.

The implementation is in Ruby, so I can cheat at garbage
collection.

## It's called Blisp

which is short for "Ben's Lisp".

Since "Blisp" is hard to type, I might rename the language
to "Blips".
